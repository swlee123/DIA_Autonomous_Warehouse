ðŸš¨ section with this symbol means it will be useful to create visualization.

## 1. Setup Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install seac_requirements.txt to run experiments using A* and Dijkstra algorithm.

```bash
pip install -r seac_requirements.txt
```

Install ad_requirements.txt to run experiments using A* and Dijkstra algorithm.

```bash
pip install -r ad_requirements.txt
```

Please make sure there is 2 separated virtual environment for (A* and Dijkstra) and SEAC as they require different dependencies.


## 2. Run experiments ðŸš¨
If you want to try to recreate the experiment in our report : 

### A* and Dijkstra

REMEMBER TO USE corresponding venv
#### Config file 

Could be found in `astar_dijkstra/config/yaml` , please adjust config accordingly to set parameter for experiments

```bash
cd astar_dijkstra
python auto_experiment.py
```

Training result is saved as CSV file in astar_dijkstra\result and .mp4 video in astar_dijkstra\video


### SEAC 

REMEMBER TO USE corresponding venv

```bash
cd seac
python evalute.py
```
Training result will be saved as CSV file in seac\result\exp_result_{ENV}.csv

## 3. Run Preset Simulations ðŸš¨

In addition to the predefined environments mentioned earlier, we also provide several preset simulation settings that can be executed with different configurations.

The original configurable parameters are:

- **Agent Count**: Number of autonomous agents in the environment.
- **Warehouse Layout**: Variation in the structural design and arrangement of shelves and pathways.

New parameters introduced by us ðŸš¨:  
- **Obstacle Location**: Fixed obstacles placed within the warehouse grid.
- **Human Count**: Number of dynamic human entities present.


### 3.1 A* and Dijkstra

There are 3 preset env to run visualization on `A*` and `Dijkstra`

1. preset1_1a1h_small.py
2. preset2-3a5h_big.py
3. preset2-3a5h_big.py

```bash
cd astar_dijkstra\preset_simulation
python preset1_1a1h_small.py --algorithm A*
```

`A*` or `Dijkstra` could be use as `--algorithm` config.


### 3.2 SEAC

```bash
cd seac
python run_seac --agent_n 2
```

`Agent_n` could be 1..5
